# How I made my portfolio website using HTML and CSS

I wanted to create a portfolio website that showcases my skills, projects, and hobbies as a second year BTech student in computer science and engineering at UPES. I specialize in full stack AI development and I'm passionate about learning new technologies and developing innovative solutions.

## Planning

Before I started coding, I planned the layout and design of my website. I sketched some mockups on paper and decided on the color scheme and fonts. I also gathered the content and images that I wanted to display on my website.

## Coding

I used HTML and CSS to code my website. I did not use any framework or library, but I used some basic concepts and techniques, such as:

- HTML tags to create the structure and content of my website
- CSS selectors, properties, and values to style and position the elements of my website
- CSS flexbox to create flexible layouts for my sections and boxes
- CSS border, border-radius, and background-color to create some visual effects for my elements

I divided my website into several sections, such as:

- A header section that contains my profile picture and some basic information about me
- An about section that contains a brief introduction of myself and my interests
- A skills and hobbies section that contains two boxes with lists of my skills and hobbies
- A projects section that contains an ordered list of my projects with links to view them
- A footer section that contains a marquee text that says "made with love by rudra"

## Testing

I tested my website on different browsers and devices to ensure that it works properly and looks good. I also checked for any errors or bugs in my code and fixed them.
